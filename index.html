    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos Sr. life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1917</strong> - Born in Sarrat, Philippines</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1930</strong> - Attended school in Manila and studied law at the University of the Philippines, near that city. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1940</strong> - He became a trial lawyer in Manila.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1942–45</strong> - During World War II he was an officer with the Philippine armed forces. Marcos’s later claims of having been a leader in the Filipino guerrilla resistance movement were a central factor in his political success, but U.S. government archives revealed that he actually played little or no part in anti-Japanese activities
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1946 to 1947</strong> - Marcos was a technical assistant to Manuel Roxas, the first president of the independent Philippine republic. He was a member of the House of Representatives (1949–59) and of the Senate (1959–65), serving as Senate president (1963–65).
      </li>
       <li>
        <strong>1959</strong> - Marcos took a seat in the senate, a position he would hold until he ran for and won the presidency in 1965 on the Nationalist Party ticket.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1965</strong> - Marcos won and was inaugurated as president. During his first term he had made progress in agriculture, industry, and education.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1969</strong> - Marcos was reelected the first Filipino president to win a second term, but violence and fraud were associated with his campaign, which was believed to be funded with millions from the national treasury. What arose from the campaign unrest became known as the First Quarter Storm, during which leftists took to the streets to demonstrate against both American involvement in Philippine affairs and the increasingly apparent dictatorial style of Ferdinand Marcos.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1972</strong> - Marcos imposed martial law on the Philippines. Holding that communist and subversive forces had precipitated the crisis, he acted swiftly; opposition politicians were jailed, and the armed forces became an arm of the regime. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1973</strong> - Marcos also oversaw a national referendum that allowed him to hold power indefinitely. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1981</strong> - Marcos announced the end of martial law. Marcos, serving as both president and prime minister by this point, resigned from the latter post, still retaining the power to implement laws at his command and imprison dissenters without due process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>June 1981</strong> - He won the presidential reelection for another six years.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1983</strong> - Marcos’s health was beginning to fail, and opposition to his rule was growing. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1984</strong> - Marcos appointed an independent commission that high military officers were responsible for Aquino’s assassination.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1986</strong> -  With his health failing and support for his regime fading fast, on February 25, 1986, Ferdinand Marcos and much of his family were airlifted from the Manila presidential palace, going into exile in Hawaii where he remained until his death.
      </li>
	  <li>
	  	<strong>1989 </strong> - Ferdinand died in Honolulu from cardiac arrest after suffering from an array of ailments.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>2016</strong> -  President Rodrigo Duterte ordered Marcos' body to be buried at the National Heroes' Cemetery in Manila, with protests erupting in opposition to such a move considering Marcos' human rights abuses. Nonetheless, in November the remains of Marcos were interred at the new site in a hero's burial.
